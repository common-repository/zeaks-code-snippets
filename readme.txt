A simple, lightweight code snippet plugin with 4 color schemes that displays code in posts similar to how Wordpress.org does. 

== Description ==

A simple code snippet plugin for anyone who wants to post any type of code on their site. It's what I've used on Zeaks.org for a while, and highly based off of Danny Van Kooten's Simple Quote Code Snippets plugin. It's lightweight, uses no JavaScript, comes with 4 editable color schemes and very easy to use.

**Note** Does not highlight code, simply displays it in a nice way and allows posting of any code.

Use [code] Your Code [/code] in any post.

1. Upload `zeaks-snippets` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
